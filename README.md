#  BazaarX

BazaarX is a modern e-commerce web application built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This repository includes the **frontend** implementation, UI components, and API integrations.

🔗 **Live Demo:**  
https://bazaar-x-frontend-vert.vercel.app/

## ⚠️ Deployment Note

> **Important:** The backend API is hosted on **Render (Free Tier)**, which uses an automatic cold-start mechanism.  
> Because of this, the **first request after a period of inactivity may take 20–30 seconds** while the server initializes.  
> Once the service is active, all subsequent API responses will be fast and normal.
